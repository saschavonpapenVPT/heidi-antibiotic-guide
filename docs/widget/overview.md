## Integration Options

The Widget can be launched in two ways to fit your EHR's user experience:

### Page Load Integration
Automatically initialize the Widget when a patient encounter page loads, providing immediate access to Heidi's capabilities.

### Button-Triggered Launch
Deploy a launch button that clinicians can activate when they're ready to begin documentation. We recommend making this button available to all users of your EHR, so they can organically try the product without barriers.
